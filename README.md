> [!NOTE]  
> While I excel at writing code and translating designs into functional and polished products, I acknowledge that design and creativity are not my strongest areas. I am constantly working to improve my skills in UI and UX design, and I am eager to collaborate with and learn from others who have expertise in these areas.
